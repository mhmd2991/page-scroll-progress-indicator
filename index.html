            <h1>The Lion, The Bear, and The Fox</h1>
            <p>A Lion and a bear found the carcass of a fawn. Both were hungry. Both wanted it. So they started to fight
                for it. The contest wass long and hard and savage. At last, when both of them, half blinded and half
                dead, lay panting on the ground without the strength to touch the prize before them, a fox came by</p>
            <p>Noting the helpless condition of the two beasts, the impudent fox stepped nimbly between them, seized the
                fawn over which they had battled, and with never a "thank you" dragged it away to his den</p>

            <h2>The Hares and the Frogs</h2>
            <p>For a long time the hares had believed themselves the most persecuted of all the animals. Everyone was
                their enemy, they said. One day, when the prospect looked especially dark, they came to the sad
                resolution that there was nothing left for them but to make away with themselves, one and all. So off
                they ran to a lake near by, determined to throw themselves into the water to be drowned.</p>
            <p>But at their approach a school of frogs seated on the shore took fright and dived into the water</p>
            <p>"Hold up!" cried the hare who was in the lead. "Let us not be too hasty. Surely our case is not so
                desperate yet, for here are other poor creatures even more fainheated than ourselves."</p>

            <h3>The Town Mouse & the Country Mouse</h3>
            <p>A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country. For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat
                stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink. The Town Mouse ate very sparingly,
                nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making it very plain that she ate the
                simple food only to be polite.</p>
            <p>pAfter the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city
                while the Country Mouse listened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in
                quiet and comfort until morning. In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all
                the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So the next day when the
                Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to go home with her to the city, she gladly said yes.</p>

            <p>When they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived, they found on the table in the dining room
                the leavings of a very fine banquet. There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses,
                indeed, the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine. But just as the Country Mouse was about to
                nibble a dainty bit of pastry, she heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at the door. In great fear the
                Mice scurried to a hiding place, where they lay quite still for a long time, hardly daring to breathe.
                When at last they ventured back to the feast, the door opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear
                the table, followed by the House Dog.</p>


            <p>The Country Mouse stopped in the Town Mouse's den only long enough to pick up her carpet bag and
                umbrella.</p>

            <p>"You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not," she said as she hurried away, "but I prefer my
                plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it."</p>
            <h5>Poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty.</h5>
